## Crucial 2 Modpack
Crucial 2 is a modpack by [Vazkii](https://vazkii.net/), creator of famous mods such as Quark, Botania, and Neat.
Crucial 2 contains many Vanilla+ additions such as blocks, mobs, and mechanics that would fit into vanilla Minecraft.

To manage modded Mincraft instances I recommend using **[PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/download)**.

The base modpack may be downoaded here:
**[Crucial 2 Base Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/crucial-2/download/3644360)**


The modpack patch may be downloaded here:
**[Crucial 2 Patch](https://github.com/League-of-Mango/Svalbard/raw/main/minecraft/modpack-patches/Crucial%202%20Patch.zip)**


Just drag the contents of the patch into your mods folder of your Crucial 2 instance. Then, disable Antique Atlas and Antique Waystone.

In addition to the base modpack, we have added the following mods and their library mods to make the modpack more interesting before the official modpack is released:
* **[Botania](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania)**
	* Magical plants that provide nice rewards. Some engineering is required to produce greater rewards. Also contains various useful magical artifacts.

	* Starlight and constellation based magic.

	* A revamped system for creating tools and weapons. Tools and weapons are now crafted from individual parts which add various modifiers and different stats based on the material used. Also adds new alloys, slimes, and tools.

	* Allows for you to put an Elytra on a Curios back slot.
* **[Friendly Fire](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/friendly-fire)**

* **[Path Under Gates](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/path-under-gates)**
	* Allows for grass path blocks to exist under fence gates.
* In addition, Antique Atlas and Antique Waystones will be disabled.

To play on the server, you **must** add these additional mods to the modpack and **disable** Antique Atlas and Antique Waystones.
All of these mods are present in the modpack patch.


## [Inter Mango's Bizarre Adventure](http://imba.leagueofmango.xyz)
